## My process

1. Analysed the design and put together list of elements that need to be coded.
2. Ordered the list working on the assumption that some items needed to be worked before others as it affected how other elements needed to be coded. A main consideration here was the needed to design for mobile first.
3. The coding work consisted of:
   1. Initializing the github repo.
   2. Creating the base folder/file structure link.
   3. Linking to any fonts/css libraries/css stylesheets as needed.
   4. Structured the index.html based on the different elements.
   5. Style the project working section/element by section/element.
   6. Ensuring I checked in my code consistently.
   7. Once the coding was complete I looked for any issues and carried any necessary adjustments.
4. I completed the README.md and pushed my solution live.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Look to use CSS variables on bigger projects.

### Continued development

I used CSS Variables for this project. I will look to use SASS in an upcoming project.
